1
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:53,709
Stand by for a message from Dianthus,

2
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:58,964
President of Earth and
Rotating Premier of the sun system.

3
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:12,978
- Barbarella?
- Mr. President.

4
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,192
- Love.
- Love.

5
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:22,112
Just a minute, I'll slip something on.

6
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,449
Don't trouble yourself.
This is an affair of state.

7
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:27,993
What I must tell you
not only is grave...

8
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:30,787
- ...it's a secret.
- A secret?

9
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:37,127
Have you ever heard of a
young scientist named Durand Durand?

10
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:39,421
- Yes.
- Recently, while on a trip

11
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:44,134
to the North Star, he vanished
into the uncharted regions of Tau Ceti.

12
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:46,136
But... why is that a secret?

13
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:50,640
Because Durand Durand is
the inventor of the Positronic Ray.

14
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:52,809
It's a... It's a weapon.

15
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,812
Weapon?

16
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:58,148
Why would anybody
want to invent a weapon?

17
00:05:58,316 --> 00:06:00,067
How should I know?

18
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:04,446
I mean the universe has been
pacified for centuries, sir.

19
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:06,239
What we know of it.

20
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:10,660
The trouble is we don't know anything
about Tau Ceti or its inhabitants.

21
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:12,371
You mean they could
still be living in a primitive state

22
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:15,082
- of neurotic irresponsibility?
- Precisely.

23
00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:18,960
And if they are, and if they have
learned from this young scientist

24
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:21,671
the unspeakable secret
of the Positronic Ray,

25
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:24,091
well, it may give them the power

26
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:27,177
to shatter the loving union
of the universe.

27
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:31,598
That could lead
to archaic insecurity, and...

28
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:33,016
And war.

29
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:36,436
You mean, selfish competition, and...

30
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:38,188
I mean war.

31
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:42,067
- Bloody conflict between entire tribes.
- I don't believe it.

32
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:46,196
Neither do I,
but we can't take the chance.

33
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,908
- Something must be done.
- Yes,

34
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:53,745
- and you are the girl who must do it.
- Why me?

35
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:59,835
Barbarella, I have no armies or police,
and I can't spare the presidential band.

36
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:04,256
Besides, you're a five-star,
double-rated Astro-Navigatrix.

37
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:06,591
Your mission then:

38
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:12,055
Find Durand Durand and use
all of your incomparable talents

39
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:16,685
to preserve the security of the stars
and our own mother planet.

40
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:18,395
- How do you read me?
- Straight.

41
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:23,692
Here is the only known photograph
of Durand Durand in existence.

42
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:28,738
Age 26, hazel eyes,
a rather handsome fellow.

43
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:34,327
I don't think I'm gonna
be able to recognize him, sir.

44
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:38,915
Now, this is a portable
brainwave detector.

45
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:47,757
Attention. Set your
atom transmitter at 0-3-5.

46
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:52,304
- Positive.
- Object in transit.

47
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:55,515
Object received.

48
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:58,852
When you wish to test
for the presence of Durand Durand,

49
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,396
simply press this contact.

50
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:04,524
The light will glow
and the alarm will sound.

51
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:06,943
It has a built-in tongue box.

52
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:11,573
Here is something you may need.

53
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:18,872
- It's a weapon?
- For self-preservation.

54
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,082
We borrowed it from
the Museum of Conflict.

55
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:25,295
That's my good girl.

56
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:29,633
One day, Barbarella,
we must meet in the flesh.

57
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:36,598
Thank you, and... Love.

58
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:38,642
Love.

59
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,732
Armed, like a naked savage.

60
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:11,174
Alpha 7 to Base, Alpha 7 to Base.

61
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:15,637
We are leaving the zone
of Solar Attraction in seven minutes.

62
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:19,849
- Acknowledge.
- Base to Alpha 7 , acknowledged.

63
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:25,105
Prepare for acceleration
into Temporal Space.

64
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:29,609
Acceleration into Temporal Space
Continuum now beginning.

65
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:43,748
Alphy, when do we get to
the Tau Ceti gravitational field?

66
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:49,170
One hundred and fifty-four hours,
seven minutes, elapses Earth time.

67
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:50,213
Right.

68
00:09:56,095 --> 00:10:00,724
- Wake me up in 154 hours.
- Confirmed.

69
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:04,102
Good night, Alphy.

70
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,646
Confirmed.

71
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:48,813
Deceleration looks in line

72
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:54,069
Barbarella rise and shine

73
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:03,828
Prepare to insert nourishment.

74
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:20,970
End of course in temporal acceleration
in seven seconds.

75
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:24,724
Alphy, it's Tau Ceti.

76
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:34,275
- What's happening?
- Magnetic disturbances.

77
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:39,239
Magnetic disturbances?

78
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,663
Emergency systems.

79
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:55,797
All emergency systems will now operate.

80
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:01,970
Our magnetic screens are dead.

81
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:06,933
Force of magnetic hurricane is 11.9.

82
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:09,769
Gyrocompass is not,

83
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:13,481
repeat, not functioning.

84
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:17,235
- You mean you can't navigate?
- That is correct.

85
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:19,112
I'll switch it to manual.

86
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:21,948
What are our chances?

87
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:25,368
Our present possibilities
of non-destruction

88
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:31,082
are 0.00002 to ten thousand.

89
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:44,679
My number two stabilizer
has been damaged.

90
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:49,744
Where am I?

91
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:52,705
That's what I was gonna ask you.

92
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:56,543
Planet 16 in the system Tau Ceti.

93
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:59,921
Air density 0.051.

94
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:03,800
Cool weather with the possibility
of stormy precipitations.

95
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:08,763
Analysis of the atmosphere: terrestrial,
with a slight excess of oxygen.

96
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:14,394
I count 600,324 molecules
per cubic millimeter.

97
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:16,521
Well, at least I'll be able to breathe.

98
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:07,030
What marvelous little girls. Hi!

99
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:10,700
Do you speak English?

100
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,834
Wait, let me adjust my tongue box.

101
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:22,337
That must be a galactic five dialect.

102
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:10,802
But I haven't skied in ages.

103
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:54,512
But that's Durand Durand's spaceship.

104
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:08,484
Hi.

105
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:34,677
Listen, you children, this game is very
amusing, but I think it's gone too far.

106
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:37,096
I don't want to hurt you.

107
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:40,558
I just want to ask you some
questions about this spaceship.

108
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:43,895
Come on, untie me
or I'm gonna call your parents.

109
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:51,694
That's very sweet, but...

110
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:15,718
No.

111
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:47,542
Help!

112
00:18:53,423 --> 00:18:55,091
Stop!

113
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,593
Hello.

114
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:27,016
Thank you.

115
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:31,020
No.

116
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:37,526
I can't understand.

117
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:45,701
I'd better adjust my tongue box.

118
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,625
Are you all right?

119
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:55,711
I think so.

120
00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:57,755
Who are you?

121
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:01,509
I am Mark Hand, the catchman.
And you, who are you?

122
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:04,011
I'm from the planet Earth.

123
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:07,014
Tell me, what do you know
of this spaceship?

124
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:08,641
I know nothing.

125
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:13,062
It was here when I accepted
the job of the catchman.

126
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:15,231
- Catchman?
- Yes.

127
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:18,818
All children must live in the ice
and forests of Weir

128
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:22,113
until they have reached
a serviceable age.

129
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:25,116
- Serviceable?
- And then I capture them with my net,

130
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:29,245
just as you have seen,
and turn them over to the authorities.

131
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:30,997
I see.

132
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:35,918
Thank you.

133
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,713
Have you ever heard the name
"Durand Durand"?

134
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,423
I know nothing of such matters.

135
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:43,092
I live alone in the ice
and forests of Weir,

136
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:46,220
such is the life of a catchman.

137
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:51,350
Only in Sogo will you find
the answer to the question you pose.

138
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:55,313
- Sogo? Is it near?
- It's just beyond that ice deck.

139
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:06,574
By the way, is that your spacecraft
I saw at the far edge of this lake?

140
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:09,577
Yes, but I'm afraid there may be
something wrong with it.

141
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:11,787
See, there was a magnetic storm,
and my stabilizers...

142
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:16,083
Perhaps I can help. I am not
without experience in these matters.

143
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:21,213
After all, it is I who must service
and maintain this ice craft.

144
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:25,259
If you'll allow me,
I'll take you to your ship.

145
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:27,470
But there's no wind.

146
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:29,930
Hold on.

147
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:41,984
What a lovely cabin.

148
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:43,527
Wind.

149
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:05,341
I'm so grateful for what you've done,
I hardly know how to begin to thank you.

150
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:09,345
I'm positive I could get you some sort
of recompense from my government.

151
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:12,890
I mean, if there's anything you need,
or that I can do, please tell me.

152
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:17,686
Well, you could let me
make love to you.

153
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:19,772
"Make love" did you say?

154
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:22,566
- Yes.
- What do you mean?

155
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:24,485
You don't even know
my psychocardiogram.

156
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:28,114
Well, on Earth,
for centuries people haven't made love

157
00:23:28,281 --> 00:23:31,659
unless their psychocardiogram readings
were in perfect confluence.

158
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:33,369
I know nothing of that.

159
00:23:33,703 --> 00:23:37,581
You asked me what you
could do for me, and I told you.

160
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:41,085
Well, all right,
but I don't see what good it will do.

161
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:43,337
- Do you have any pills?
- Pills?!

162
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:46,173
Oh, never mind. I have some, here.

163
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,052
What is this pill?

164
00:23:50,887 --> 00:23:53,597
It's an exaltation
transference pellet, of course.

165
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:56,725
- I know nothing of this.
- I see.

166
00:23:56,893 --> 00:23:59,145
Well, on Earth, when our
psychocardiogram readings

167
00:23:59,312 --> 00:24:02,064
are in harmony, and we wish
to "make love," as you call it,

168
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:05,609
we take an exaltation transference
pellet and remain like this.

169
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:07,194
Here, let me show you.

170
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:11,532
For one minute,
or until full rapport is achieved.

171
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:24,587
I don't care for that.
This, this is what I mean.

172
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:27,173
This, a bed.

173
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:29,925
That?

174
00:24:30,093 --> 00:24:34,013
But nobody has done that for centuries.
I mean, nobody except the very poor

175
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:36,474
who can't afford the pills
and the psychocardiogram readings.

176
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:38,851
- Why not?
- Because it was proved to be

177
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:41,604
distracting and a danger
to maximum efficiency.

178
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:45,524
And... because it was pointless to
continue it when other substitutes

179
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:48,110
for ego support and self-esteem
were made available.

180
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:50,362
So... you won't do it?

181
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:54,450
Well, if you simply must insist,
I guess so.

182
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:57,953
But I can assure you there's really
no point at all in doing it like this.

183
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:06,962
Without your... garments, please.

184
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:06,272
Now, I'll have a look
at your stabilizers.

185
00:26:12,487 --> 00:26:17,950
Since your garment is torn, you may
help yourself to my furs, Barbarella.

186
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:27,102
I think I have found the trouble.

187
00:27:28,563 --> 00:27:30,272
You may proceed now to Sogo.

188
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:33,192
It's there you will find
Durand Durand, Jr...

189
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:36,487
...if he still lives.

190
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:38,781
Good.

191
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:43,285
And now, Barbarella,
don't you agree with me

192
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:48,791
that in some things the
old-fashioned ways are best, after all?

193
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:50,417
What?

194
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:52,961
Oh, that.

195
00:27:53,129 --> 00:27:56,465
Yes, I must admit it was
rather... interesting.

196
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,927
Still, I see what they mean
by saying it's distracting.

197
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:02,012
Are you coming with me to Sogo?

198
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:05,265
No, I prefer the tranquility of the ice
and forests of Weir.

199
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:08,143
The life of Sogo is too strict,
and the people too dedicated.

200
00:28:08,311 --> 00:28:13,440
But, perhaps, you'll stop this way again
after you've completed your mission.

201
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:16,193
Yes, perhaps I will.

202
00:28:18,321 --> 00:28:20,989
Well, good-bye and thanks again...

203
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:24,827
...for everything.

204
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:27,413
Oh, it was my pleasure.

205
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:35,879
Please advise present situation.

206
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:38,215
You wouldn't understand.

207
00:28:55,859 --> 00:29:00,195
- Stabilizers malfunctioning.
- I've been repaired in reverse.

208
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:03,991
We're going in.
I'll activate the Terra screw.

209
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:32,561
Barbarella!

210
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:37,149
Full operational power
on all subterranean systems.

211
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,576
Forty-five degree ascent.

212
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:51,371
Quarter-to-half for surfacing.

213
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:25,614
I gotta get rid of this tail.

214
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:42,816
- I'm dead.
- No.

215
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:49,573
Where am I?

216
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:52,034
We are in the labyrinth
of the City of Night.

217
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:53,744
Are you an angel?

218
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:56,705
I'm Pygar,
the last of the ornithanthropes.

219
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:00,792
How do you do?

220
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:05,964
- And you?
- I'm from the planet Earth.

221
00:32:06,132 --> 00:32:08,216
My name is Barbarella.

222
00:32:09,385 --> 00:32:13,722
But you're soft and warm.
We're told that Earth beings are cold.

223
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:16,224
Not all of us.

224
00:32:17,393 --> 00:32:20,562
Oh, my poor spaceship. Look at it.

225
00:32:22,982 --> 00:32:24,733
I'm so sorry.

226
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:28,070
Pygar, what happened to your eyes?

227
00:32:28,237 --> 00:32:32,324
Oh, I fell during a magnetic storm on
this planet, and was carried to Sogo.

228
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:33,825
Sogo?

229
00:32:33,993 --> 00:32:36,745
The City of Night,
where the Great Tyrant reigns.

230
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:39,373
There my eyes were destroyed,
and I was left to perish here

231
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:42,167
in the labyrinth
where Professor Ping found me.

232
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:44,002
That's terrible.

233
00:32:48,257 --> 00:32:49,925
Can you really fly?

234
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:55,138
- No, I've lost the will to fly.
- How awful.

235
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,225
It no longer matters.
It's all in the past.

236
00:32:58,393 --> 00:33:02,187
Pygar, have you ever heard
of the name Durand Durand?

237
00:33:03,272 --> 00:33:04,439
Durand Durand?

238
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:08,151
Yes, Durand Durand.
He's an astronaut from the planet Earth.

239
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:10,779
I do not know of such things.

240
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:17,494
- Perhaps Professor Ping can help.
- Professor Ping?

241
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:20,747
He is wise in all matters
and knows well the affairs of Sogo.

242
00:33:20,915 --> 00:33:24,334
- Where can I find him?
- He's with the others, eating.

243
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:36,907
He's there. Professor Ping.

244
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:40,285
- Professor Ping?
- Yes?

245
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:42,287
My name is Barbarella.

246
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:48,627
Tell me, what is your origin?

247
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:53,173
You have the aspect of an earthling.

248
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:57,844
You are of female gender, are you not?

249
00:34:58,012 --> 00:34:59,387
That is correct.

250
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:04,226
- Is that an orchid?
- Yes.

251
00:35:04,393 --> 00:35:07,395
You see, orchids have
very little food value,

252
00:35:07,563 --> 00:35:10,398
and they're extremely difficult
to cultivate in this climate.

253
00:35:10,566 --> 00:35:16,071
It amuses the Great Tyrant to resent the
expense of feeding orchids to slaves.

254
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:19,407
What kind of place is this?

255
00:35:19,575 --> 00:35:24,454
Well, now, that is Sogo, City of Night,

256
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:29,167
ruled by the Great Tyrant
and dedicated to evil in every form.

257
00:35:29,335 --> 00:35:32,379
And this is the labyrinth.

258
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:36,925
All that is not evil
is exiled to the labyrinth.

259
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:39,177
Look.

260
00:35:49,605 --> 00:35:51,064
Who is that gentleman?

261
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:54,234
Now, that is one of the
Grand Grotesques.

262
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:58,113
That's the classic way
of ending life in the labyrinth.

263
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:05,120
Professor Ping, excuse me,

264
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:08,165
have you ever heard of a man
called Durand Durand?

265
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:11,626
Durand Durand, from the planet Earth?

266
00:36:12,795 --> 00:36:15,714
- Yes, indeed.
- He's alive?

267
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:18,091
- Where?
- In Sogo, no doubt.

268
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:20,719
I must go there at once.

269
00:36:22,054 --> 00:36:26,308
But as you've seen,
no one may leave the labyrinth.

270
00:36:26,934 --> 00:36:29,352
I have a spaceship,
if I can get it going.

271
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,480
My child, perhaps
I can be of assistance.

272
00:36:32,648 --> 00:36:35,275
Oh, if you only could.
Let me take you there.

273
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:39,070
- Yeah, yeah.
- Pygar, will you show us the way?

274
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:15,982
What seems to be the trouble?

275
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:19,361
Well, I'm not sure, exactly,
but I think it's the stabilizers.

276
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:21,780
Let's have a look.

277
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:32,374
Pygar, pen.

278
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:36,127
Here.

279
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:38,546
Thank you.

280
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:43,134
Thank heaven the hypotondical
molecules are undamaged.

281
00:37:43,302 --> 00:37:46,137
- Will it take long?
- Hours?

282
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:48,556
Days? Weeks?

283
00:37:48,724 --> 00:37:53,395
Who knows.
Genius is mysterious.

284
00:37:53,562 --> 00:37:56,398
But I can't wait weeks.

285
00:37:58,484 --> 00:37:59,901
Pygar...

286
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:03,571
...you can fly me there.

287
00:38:03,739 --> 00:38:05,240
No, I cannot.

288
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:08,243
Atrophy of the greater alea muscle.

289
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:12,414
The angel is aerodynamically sound.

290
00:38:15,084 --> 00:38:17,752
It's all a question of morale.

291
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:24,676
Well, there is nothing to do but wait.

292
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:28,096
Pygar, where do you live?

293
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:32,392
Come. I'll tell you how to lead me.

294
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:40,734
Just ahead.

295
00:38:41,902 --> 00:38:45,905
- It's a nest!
- Why, yes, that's where I live.

296
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:48,116
It's marvelous.

297
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:51,369
I'm glad you like it.

298
00:38:55,124 --> 00:38:57,709
Wait, they're coming.

299
00:39:07,136 --> 00:39:08,595
Help!

300
00:39:11,265 --> 00:39:12,640
Pygar, right in front of you.

301
00:39:14,935 --> 00:39:17,479
No, Pygar, no, to the right.

302
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,147
Now!

303
00:39:30,409 --> 00:39:31,993
What is it?

304
00:39:32,161 --> 00:39:35,455
One of the Black Guards
in the service of the Great Tyrant.

305
00:39:35,998 --> 00:39:38,833
But there isn't anybody in there.

306
00:39:39,001 --> 00:39:44,339
No. The Black Guards are leather men,
they are without fleshy substance.

307
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:49,844
Pygar, you saved my life.

308
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:13,993
Pygar?

309
00:40:15,704 --> 00:40:18,540
Py... Oh, Pygar!

310
00:40:18,707 --> 00:40:20,917
Be careful.

311
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:24,254
Oh, Pygar.

312
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:29,968
Interesting therapy.

313
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:46,484
- I've regained the will to fly.
- I know.

314
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:48,820
Oh, it was...

315
00:40:49,738 --> 00:40:51,197
It was just heavenly.

316
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:54,075
Can you take me to Sogo?

317
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:58,121
- But I cannot see.
- I will be your eyes, Pygar.

318
00:40:58,581 --> 00:40:59,998
I do not believe it is possible.

319
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:02,500
We'd be shot down
by the Black Guard patrols.

320
00:41:03,419 --> 00:41:06,087
Not with my
mini-missile projector, we won't.

321
00:41:53,093 --> 00:41:55,053
Are you all right, Pygar?

322
00:41:55,888 --> 00:41:57,388
Yes, thank you.

323
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:20,453
I don't like the looks of that.

324
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:43,434
A little to the right.

325
00:42:55,197 --> 00:42:56,364
Pygar, watch out!

326
00:43:04,373 --> 00:43:05,582
I got him.

327
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:10,086
To the right.

328
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:43,786
Up, Pygar, up!

329
00:43:57,509 --> 00:43:59,927
We'll try to hide behind that mountain.

330
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:13,107
Pygar!

331
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:47,016
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

332
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:18,756
Just in time,
my energy box is completely dead.

333
00:45:18,924 --> 00:45:20,800
Are we all right now?

334
00:45:22,177 --> 00:45:25,388
I think so. Excuse me.

335
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:39,861
We're there.
It's right below us.

336
00:45:40,028 --> 00:45:43,114
We must land in a back street,
for your sake.

337
00:45:43,866 --> 00:45:47,118
To be seen in Sogo with an angel
would be anathema.

338
00:45:47,828 --> 00:45:49,203
Oh, I see.

339
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:55,042
Pygar, keep your head down.

340
00:46:26,408 --> 00:46:27,575
Oh, my.

341
00:46:29,411 --> 00:46:31,621
We must find something
to hide your wings.

342
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:53,893
Wait, Barbarella.

343
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:03,152
Don't be afraid, Pygar.

344
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:05,488
I sense danger, guard yourself.

345
00:47:08,075 --> 00:47:11,786
There's nothing, I promise you. Come.

346
00:47:36,895 --> 00:47:37,895
Barbarella?

347
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:41,107
Pygar, wait for me!

348
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:45,194
What do you want of me?

349
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:01,377
Hello, Pretty-pretty.

350
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:05,214
Hello.

351
00:48:10,178 --> 00:48:11,470
Thank you very much.

352
00:48:11,638 --> 00:48:13,931
Do you want to come and play with me?

353
00:48:15,517 --> 00:48:18,144
For someone like you I charge nothing.

354
00:48:23,191 --> 00:48:25,985
You're very pretty, Pretty-pretty.

355
00:48:26,153 --> 00:48:29,238
My name isn't Pretty-pretty,
it's Barbarella.

356
00:48:45,297 --> 00:48:47,757
Have you seen an angel anywhere?

357
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:51,552
- The strange bird?
- Yes.

358
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:03,397
What's that screaming?

359
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:07,401
A good many dramatic situations
begin with screaming.

360
00:49:32,135 --> 00:49:33,552
Pygar?

361
00:49:58,245 --> 00:50:00,621
Pygar, back up,
there's a room behind you.

362
00:50:18,473 --> 00:50:20,391
They're not following.

363
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:25,855
Pygar, come.

364
00:50:27,816 --> 00:50:29,900
Tell me what that means.

365
00:50:30,819 --> 00:50:31,986
Chamber...

366
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:35,489
...of ultimate...

367
00:50:38,201 --> 00:50:39,994
...solution.

368
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:42,496
I don't like the sound of that.

369
00:50:48,378 --> 00:50:50,337
I think we'd better get out of here.

370
00:50:53,842 --> 00:50:56,677
Ye who have chosen to die, be welcome.

371
00:50:56,845 --> 00:51:00,431
To terminate the bitterness of life,
you are entitled to select

372
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:05,394
from three exciting
and surprising forms of death,

373
00:51:05,562 --> 00:51:10,649
one of which awaits beyond each
of the doors you see before you.

374
00:51:10,817 --> 00:51:15,196
Should you fail to choose,
you will be given to the mathmos.

375
00:51:15,363 --> 00:51:19,867
There is no appeal. Next solution.

376
00:51:47,312 --> 00:51:51,732
- Next solution.
- We'd better take the chance.

377
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:07,957
Wait!

378
00:52:19,052 --> 00:52:21,178
Oh, thank you very much.

379
00:52:23,056 --> 00:52:24,682
You must come with me.

380
00:52:28,103 --> 00:52:31,355
Tell me, what is your name,
and what do you do in life?

381
00:52:31,523 --> 00:52:34,066
I'm concierge to the Great Tyrant.

382
00:52:34,234 --> 00:52:36,777
I must congratulate you
on your sense of timing.

383
00:52:36,945 --> 00:52:38,445
Oh, no, that wasn't me.

384
00:52:38,613 --> 00:52:41,073
That was so ordained
by the Great Tyrant.

385
00:52:41,241 --> 00:52:45,953
I see. Tell me, what is
that horrible thing under the floor?

386
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:51,167
That is the mathmos, my child.

387
00:52:51,334 --> 00:52:52,835
The mathmos?

388
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:56,672
You really are from Earth,
you don't understand?

389
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:58,132
No.

390
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:01,260
The mathmos... yes.

391
00:53:01,428 --> 00:53:03,971
Well, you see, the whole city
is built over a lake.

392
00:53:04,139 --> 00:53:09,143
A very curious lake, composed
like you and I of living energy,

393
00:53:09,311 --> 00:53:11,812
but energy in liquid form.

394
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:14,356
And it watches us.

395
00:53:16,193 --> 00:53:19,486
It is magnetic,
and being positively charged,

396
00:53:19,654 --> 00:53:23,324
it feeds on negative psychic vibrations,

397
00:53:23,491 --> 00:53:25,868
what you would call "evil."

398
00:53:26,411 --> 00:53:32,416
Yes, it thrives on evil thoughts,
deeds and flesh.

399
00:53:32,584 --> 00:53:35,920
And, in return, it gives us
warmth, light and life itself.

400
00:53:36,087 --> 00:53:39,840
But... it has a terrible appetite.

401
00:53:41,384 --> 00:53:43,761
Perhaps you'll see some other time.

402
00:53:44,846 --> 00:53:46,639
Pygar, Pygar!

403
00:53:46,806 --> 00:53:50,309
Don't be concerned, my child.
You'll see him again soon enough.

404
00:53:50,477 --> 00:53:53,187
Now, if you'll just come this way.

405
00:53:54,522 --> 00:53:55,981
There, sit.

406
00:53:57,025 --> 00:53:59,735
I'm afraid you must do as I say.

407
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:04,949
Sit.

408
00:54:05,116 --> 00:54:08,869
Forward, please.

409
00:54:17,379 --> 00:54:19,046
- Oh, Moxys!
- What?

410
00:54:19,214 --> 00:54:22,466
Look, Moxys, the earthling.

411
00:54:22,634 --> 00:54:24,718
You get her, get her now.

412
00:54:25,512 --> 00:54:28,639
The concierge will never let us.
He always spoils our fun.

413
00:54:28,807 --> 00:54:30,599
Let's try anyway.

414
00:54:50,412 --> 00:54:52,705
- Play with us, earthling.
- You must play with us.

415
00:54:52,872 --> 00:54:54,248
We have lots of dolls.

416
00:54:54,416 --> 00:54:55,916
Good heavens,
what are they doing here?

417
00:54:56,084 --> 00:54:58,877
Well, well,
that's Stomoxys and Glossina.

418
00:54:59,045 --> 00:55:02,923
Nieces of the Great Tyrant,
and very highly favored in our court.

419
00:55:03,091 --> 00:55:05,467
- Why not with us?
- That's not fair.

420
00:55:05,635 --> 00:55:08,345
Hush, it's the Great Tyrant's
turn, children.

421
00:55:08,513 --> 00:55:09,930
- We saw her first.
- Now be good girls.

422
00:55:10,098 --> 00:55:13,142
Come on, Glossina.
Here, come stay by me.

423
00:55:32,579 --> 00:55:35,414
So, my pretty-pretty, we meet again.

424
00:55:57,228 --> 00:56:00,564
You, the little one-eyed wench.

425
00:56:00,732 --> 00:56:03,776
You have a good memory, Pretty-pretty.

426
00:56:03,943 --> 00:56:06,653
Yes, sometimes
I like to go among my people.

427
00:56:07,322 --> 00:56:10,032
Be like them, ordinary.

428
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:12,951
Evil, as you call it.

429
00:56:15,413 --> 00:56:19,333
So, I am your little one-eyed wench.

430
00:56:19,501 --> 00:56:22,211
I am also the Great Tyrant.

431
00:56:23,171 --> 00:56:27,674
- Well, that's nice.
- It amuses me immensely.

432
00:56:27,842 --> 00:56:30,677
Now, I suppose you are interested
in the whereabouts and welfare

433
00:56:30,845 --> 00:56:34,014
- of a certain party, yes?
- Yes, I am.

434
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:38,477
I'm here on the orders of the
President of the Republic of Earth.

435
00:56:38,645 --> 00:56:40,687
I'm here to find Durand Durand.

436
00:56:40,855 --> 00:56:44,024
I am not talking about him.
I'm speaking of the angel.

437
00:56:44,192 --> 00:56:47,903
- Pygar?
- Yes, Pygar.

438
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:52,074
He has escaped the labyrinth. Crime.

439
00:56:53,243 --> 00:56:58,580
He has destroyed
12 of my Black Guards. Crime.

440
00:56:58,748 --> 00:57:02,126
And he dares to deprive me...

441
00:57:02,293 --> 00:57:07,423
...of a pleasure unique in Sogo:
an earthling. Crime.

442
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:09,883
- Crime.
- Where is Pygar?

443
00:57:10,051 --> 00:57:12,553
You want your fine-feathered friend?

444
00:57:14,639 --> 00:57:16,432
There he is.

445
00:57:26,985 --> 00:57:28,318
Pygar.

446
00:57:37,245 --> 00:57:40,789
Amusing isn't it, Pretty-pretty?

447
00:57:40,957 --> 00:57:45,419
Don't you feel like playing,
Pretty-pretty?

448
00:57:45,587 --> 00:57:49,756
- You can play with us if you want.
- Yes, why not?

449
00:57:51,009 --> 00:57:53,093
Good, Pretty-pretty.

450
00:57:53,261 --> 00:57:57,264
You see, the mathmos is
having its effect on you already.

451
00:58:00,018 --> 00:58:04,313
It's the fumes,
they make one want to play.

452
00:58:10,153 --> 00:58:11,945
- De-crucify the Angel.
- What?

453
00:58:12,113 --> 00:58:14,114
De-crucify him or I'll melt your face.

454
00:58:25,376 --> 00:58:28,420
My face, my beautiful face.

455
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:33,884
- Stop or I'll shoot.
- Stop, my face.

456
00:58:34,052 --> 00:58:35,802
I warn you.

457
00:58:35,970 --> 00:58:39,681
How dare you endanger my face?

458
00:58:41,267 --> 00:58:44,311
Observe her power buckle, Your Majesty.

459
00:58:45,855 --> 00:58:50,025
Depleted. This weapon
is as harmless as a child's toy.

460
00:58:53,112 --> 00:58:54,988
So, it was a trick, was it?

461
00:58:55,156 --> 00:58:58,617
You should have
saved your tricks for, for...

462
00:58:58,785 --> 00:59:00,661
For the birds, Your Majesty?

463
00:59:00,828 --> 00:59:03,288
Yes! Yes, the birds.

464
00:59:03,456 --> 00:59:05,624
The birds. Give her to the birds.

465
00:59:07,669 --> 00:59:09,253
You must!

466
00:59:28,106 --> 00:59:31,400
Tell me, my fancy, fuzzy freak,

467
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:35,195
what do you think of
when you make love to Barbarella?

468
00:59:35,363 --> 00:59:38,073
Make love?
I do not understand.

469
00:59:38,950 --> 00:59:42,578
Don't be coy with me.
You're in no position.

470
00:59:43,454 --> 00:59:47,082
If only you had one eye in your head
you would see what a delight I am.

471
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:52,879
My face, my body.
All my things are a delight.

472
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:56,842
An exquisite delight.

473
00:59:58,136 --> 01:00:01,763
- What is it you want?
- I shall share my delights with you.

474
01:00:01,931 --> 01:00:04,349
You shall make love to me.

475
01:00:06,811 --> 01:00:10,355
An angel does not make love,
an angel is love.

476
01:00:10,523 --> 01:00:14,067
Then you're a dead duck. Guards!

477
01:00:16,696 --> 01:00:19,489
To the mathmos
with this winged fruitcake.

478
01:00:32,503 --> 01:00:33,837
Come along.

479
01:00:35,548 --> 01:00:36,965
Get inside.

480
01:00:54,442 --> 01:00:56,401
Oh, how darling.

481
01:00:57,945 --> 01:00:59,112
Oh, my...

482
01:01:20,551 --> 01:01:27,474
Help!

483
01:01:32,063 --> 01:01:34,439
This is really much too poetic
a way to die.

484
01:02:00,299 --> 01:02:02,050
Password, quickly.

485
01:02:03,052 --> 01:02:05,053
I don't understand.

486
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:08,473
You are a political prisoner?

487
01:02:09,851 --> 01:02:13,186
- I don't think so.
- Then you're not one of us?

488
01:02:14,105 --> 01:02:16,857
- I'm from Earth.
- Earth?

489
01:02:17,358 --> 01:02:21,111
Planet of the revolutions.
Will you join our cause?

490
01:02:21,279 --> 01:02:23,989
What cause? Who are you?

491
01:02:25,324 --> 01:02:30,036
I am Dildano, head of the revolutionary
forces. This is our headquarters.

492
01:02:34,876 --> 01:02:36,585
- Long live the revolution.
- The revolution.

493
01:02:36,753 --> 01:02:38,336
Patrol report.

494
01:02:43,384 --> 01:02:47,804
Second level, immediately.
No, take the secret passage.

495
01:03:01,861 --> 01:03:04,613
The door, the door.

496
01:03:05,406 --> 01:03:07,115
The door!

497
01:03:15,708 --> 01:03:18,084
Are you typical of Earth women?

498
01:03:20,379 --> 01:03:21,922
I'm about average.

499
01:03:23,549 --> 01:03:25,175
Tell me, how did I
get out of the bird cage?

500
01:03:25,343 --> 01:03:28,303
Through one of our
secret escape chutes.

501
01:03:28,471 --> 01:03:31,848
We've established several secret
escape chutes throughout the city,

502
01:03:32,016 --> 01:03:34,559
indicated on this map
by these lights, here.

503
01:03:41,108 --> 01:03:42,943
It's for the protection of our group.

504
01:03:47,782 --> 01:03:49,699
I suppose you realize
you've saved my life.

505
01:03:49,867 --> 01:03:52,869
A life without cause
is a life without effect.

506
01:03:53,788 --> 01:03:56,998
I'm sure I could get you a substantial
recompense from my government.

507
01:03:58,543 --> 01:04:01,795
Earth woman, shall I tell you
what I would like?

508
01:04:04,215 --> 01:04:05,966
I think I know.

509
01:04:13,558 --> 01:04:15,600
No. No, not like that.

510
01:04:16,602 --> 01:04:19,396
Like on Earth, on Earth. The pill.

511
01:04:19,564 --> 01:04:21,523
I have the pill.

512
01:04:22,024 --> 01:04:23,191
But...

513
01:04:28,197 --> 01:04:29,781
Couldn't we do it your way?

514
01:04:31,033 --> 01:04:32,993
I don't want to change your traditions.

515
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:34,619
I'm not a savage.

516
01:04:42,295 --> 01:04:43,837
The pill.

517
01:04:44,547 --> 01:04:45,839
All right.

518
01:04:47,174 --> 01:04:49,759
Five years I've waited
for this experience.

519
01:04:50,595 --> 01:04:51,887
Oh, wait!

520
01:04:58,185 --> 01:04:59,185
No...

521
01:05:52,531 --> 01:05:54,240
Long live the revolution...

522
01:06:00,081 --> 01:06:01,748
My group must...

523
01:06:20,101 --> 01:06:21,101
Hello.

524
01:06:24,438 --> 01:06:26,272
Oh, sorry about that.

525
01:06:33,072 --> 01:06:35,448
My group must have a more...

526
01:07:13,529 --> 01:07:14,821
Where did you get those pills?

527
01:07:16,157 --> 01:07:18,491
Only Earth people know of those pills.

528
01:07:25,291 --> 01:07:27,208
You there, John Paul, what news?

529
01:07:27,376 --> 01:07:31,838
My group must have more weapons
before we can launch an attack.

530
01:07:32,006 --> 01:07:34,883
You'll return to your position and
stand by. You will receive your orders.

531
01:07:35,051 --> 01:07:36,593
Right.

532
01:07:38,512 --> 01:07:40,764
You will receive your orders.

533
01:07:40,931 --> 01:07:43,183
- Long live the revolution.
- Revolution.

534
01:07:44,101 --> 01:07:46,186
The door, the door. The door!

535
01:07:53,110 --> 01:07:55,820
You must tell me,
where did you get those pills?

536
01:07:55,988 --> 01:07:59,199
Did an Earth person give them to you,
a man called Durand Durand?

537
01:08:00,159 --> 01:08:03,036
- That's correct.
- Well, where is he?

538
01:08:03,204 --> 01:08:06,539
He gave me those when he first arrived
in Sogo. I haven't seen him since.

539
01:08:06,707 --> 01:08:09,167
He's assumed to be alive somewhere,
probably in the castle.

540
01:08:09,335 --> 01:08:11,044
Do you have anything I can...?

541
01:08:11,212 --> 01:08:13,338
Of course, one of our secret uniforms.

542
01:08:13,506 --> 01:08:15,048
Thank you.

543
01:08:17,718 --> 01:08:20,595
I was sent here by my government
to find Durand Durand.

544
01:08:20,763 --> 01:08:24,682
Your government... That must mean...

545
01:08:24,850 --> 01:08:28,812
That must mean that you have your
spacecraft and weapons as well?

546
01:08:28,979 --> 01:08:31,314
Well, yes, of course.

547
01:08:31,482 --> 01:08:33,358
I don't like this red.

548
01:08:33,526 --> 01:08:35,860
Would you lend
your equipment to our cause?

549
01:08:36,028 --> 01:08:40,323
Oh, no, I couldn't do that, not until
I've accomplished my own mission.

550
01:08:48,833 --> 01:08:51,417
Perhaps... perhaps
we can strike a bargain.

551
01:08:53,045 --> 01:08:54,587
What do you mean?

552
01:08:54,755 --> 01:08:58,091
Only the Black Queen would know
the whereabouts of Durand Durand,

553
01:08:58,259 --> 01:09:00,593
and she has but one vulnerable moment.

554
01:09:00,761 --> 01:09:02,929
When she's in her
secret chamber of dreams.

555
01:09:04,306 --> 01:09:05,932
Secret chamber of dreams?

556
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:10,436
Yes. She sleep... She sleeps alone
in a room above the mathmos

557
01:09:10,604 --> 01:09:12,480
surrounded by a wall
of impenetrable energy,

558
01:09:12,648 --> 01:09:14,107
to which she alone has the secret key.

559
01:09:14,275 --> 01:09:18,528
There exists, however, a second secret
key which my agents have located,

560
01:09:18,696 --> 01:09:20,280
and is now in my possession.

561
01:09:20,447 --> 01:09:23,783
You want to discover the whereabouts
of Durand Durand,

562
01:09:23,951 --> 01:09:27,829
I want to capture the Black Queen.
You follow my meaning?

563
01:09:28,706 --> 01:09:34,002
If you really do have the second secret
key, why haven't you used it already?

564
01:09:38,465 --> 01:09:40,466
Because our forces have
not as yet been strong enough.

565
01:09:40,634 --> 01:09:45,722
The capture of the Black Queen has
to be associated with a military coup.

566
01:09:47,099 --> 01:09:49,350
With your weaponry and spacecraft,
this can be brought about.

567
01:09:49,518 --> 01:09:50,977
With the Black Queen in your control,

568
01:09:51,145 --> 01:09:53,771
you can get her to divulge the
whereabouts of Durand Durand.

569
01:09:53,939 --> 01:09:56,608
- Yes, I see.
- Good.

570
01:09:56,942 --> 01:09:59,235
I need six hours to ready my attack.

571
01:10:01,530 --> 01:10:04,365
Well, first we're going to
have to contact Professor Ping

572
01:10:04,533 --> 01:10:06,326
to find out if Alpha 7
has been repaired.

573
01:10:06,493 --> 01:10:09,287
Easily done.
I have a secret radio transmitter.

574
01:10:13,667 --> 01:10:15,335
Secret radio transmitter...

575
01:10:25,429 --> 01:10:28,348
Professor Ping to Headquarters,
Professor Ping to Headquarters.

576
01:10:28,515 --> 01:10:30,516
- Professor Ping to Headquarters.
- No.

577
01:10:31,518 --> 01:10:34,187
Headquarters to Professor Ping.
Headquarters to Professor Ping.

578
01:10:34,355 --> 01:10:35,897
- Come in, Ping.
- Yes, this is Ping.

579
01:10:36,065 --> 01:10:38,983
- Receiving you loud and clear.
- I have the earthling...

580
01:10:39,151 --> 01:10:42,028
- Barbarella.
- ...Barbarella, with me.

581
01:10:42,196 --> 01:10:44,781
She has offered us the use
of her craft and weaponry.

582
01:10:44,949 --> 01:10:48,826
- Is her craft in good working order?
- Yes, I have repaired the stabilizers,

583
01:10:48,994 --> 01:10:51,204
and the craft is ready for flight now.

584
01:10:53,624 --> 01:10:54,999
- Excellent.
- Thank you.

585
01:10:55,167 --> 01:10:56,668
There is one danger, however.

586
01:10:56,835 --> 01:10:58,753
A Black Guard patrol
has spotted the craft

587
01:10:58,921 --> 01:11:01,130
and may return at
any moment to destroy it.

588
01:11:01,298 --> 01:11:02,882
Good heavens.

589
01:11:03,050 --> 01:11:06,636
I have therefore preprogrammed it
to fly to a place of concealment

590
01:11:06,804 --> 01:11:08,137
outside the labyrinth.

591
01:11:08,305 --> 01:11:12,308
- You're a wizard, Ping.
- It is taking off even now.

592
01:11:12,476 --> 01:11:16,271
There it goes.
Perfect flight pattern.

593
01:11:17,815 --> 01:11:21,859
Our rendezvous point
will be at 1600 hours.

594
01:11:22,027 --> 01:11:24,570
And our password will be...

595
01:11:28,492 --> 01:11:29,867
You mean the secret...?

596
01:11:32,913 --> 01:11:34,580
Exactly.

597
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:38,584
- Right?
- Right.

598
01:11:40,045 --> 01:11:43,589
Headquarters signing off.
Headquarters signing off.

599
01:11:58,188 --> 01:12:01,024
The time is right.
The Queen is in her chamber of dreams.

600
01:12:01,191 --> 01:12:02,942
What about the key?

601
01:12:03,110 --> 01:12:04,694
Ah, the key.

602
01:12:10,576 --> 01:12:12,410
There is the secret key.

603
01:12:12,578 --> 01:12:13,953
Where?

604
01:12:14,913 --> 01:12:16,622
It's invisible, of course.

605
01:12:16,790 --> 01:12:20,168
Only an invisible key
can open an invisible wall.

606
01:12:25,466 --> 01:12:27,133
Where?

607
01:12:30,888 --> 01:12:34,140
My mathmos... The key!

608
01:12:38,270 --> 01:12:39,645
The key.

609
01:12:43,525 --> 01:12:44,776
I have it.

610
01:12:54,995 --> 01:12:57,080
I'll put it around your secret neck.

611
01:13:02,628 --> 01:13:04,170
It's invisible.

612
01:13:07,007 --> 01:13:12,345
Now... now, the secret map that will
lead you to the 12th corridor.

613
01:13:13,680 --> 01:13:15,348
Twelfth corridor?

614
01:13:20,062 --> 01:13:21,687
Good.

615
01:13:22,773 --> 01:13:24,148
This way.

616
01:13:40,374 --> 01:13:42,417
- Long live the revolution.
- Revolution.

617
01:13:47,381 --> 01:13:48,798
One moment.

618
01:14:19,663 --> 01:14:21,956
I'm just not the tube type.

619
01:15:11,298 --> 01:15:16,093
Excuse me, could you tell me
how to get to the 12th corridor?

620
01:15:28,148 --> 01:15:29,857
I have a taste for you.

621
01:15:44,498 --> 01:15:47,792
- What is it?
- Essence of man.

622
01:15:48,627 --> 01:15:51,963
- Essence of man?
- Yeah.

623
01:16:06,228 --> 01:16:10,898
Well, well, so you escaped the birds?
Just as well.

624
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:13,985
Now it's my turn for some amusement.

625
01:16:14,903 --> 01:16:16,070
Come with me.

626
01:16:18,365 --> 01:16:20,283
This way, please.

627
01:17:07,998 --> 01:17:11,334
- What is this thing?
- You will soon see, my dear.

628
01:17:12,210 --> 01:17:16,088
Sonata for executioner
and various young women.

629
01:17:20,469 --> 01:17:21,552
It's...

630
01:17:23,138 --> 01:17:24,555
It's sort of nice, isn't it?

631
01:17:24,723 --> 01:17:28,643
Yes, it is nice, in the beginning.

632
01:17:35,609 --> 01:17:38,110
Wait until the tune changes.

633
01:17:38,278 --> 01:17:40,488
You may change your tune as well.

634
01:17:41,281 --> 01:17:42,823
Oh, goodness.

635
01:17:43,367 --> 01:17:45,034
What do you mean?

636
01:17:58,465 --> 01:18:02,218
When we reach the crescendo,
you will die... of pleasure.

637
01:18:02,386 --> 01:18:06,764
Your end will be swift
but sweet, very sweet.

638
01:19:47,365 --> 01:19:50,451
What's this? I don't believe it.

639
01:19:50,911 --> 01:19:52,912
It couldn't be.

640
01:19:53,079 --> 01:19:55,247
Wretched, wretched girl!

641
01:19:55,415 --> 01:19:57,583
What have you done
to my excessive machine?

642
01:19:57,751 --> 01:20:01,253
You've undone it! You've undone me!
Look, look!

643
01:20:01,421 --> 01:20:03,923
The energy cables are shrinking.

644
01:20:04,090 --> 01:20:06,133
You've turned them into fagots!

645
01:20:06,301 --> 01:20:09,386
You... You've burned out
the excessive machine.

646
01:20:09,554 --> 01:20:13,766
- You've blown all its fuses.
- My goodness.

647
01:20:13,934 --> 01:20:18,270
You've exhausted its power.
It couldn't keep up with you.

648
01:20:18,438 --> 01:20:20,272
This is incredible.

649
01:20:21,107 --> 01:20:24,360
What kind of girl are you?
Have you no shame?

650
01:20:28,907 --> 01:20:31,742
Shame, shame on you.

651
01:20:31,910 --> 01:20:33,786
You'll pay for this.

652
01:20:35,580 --> 01:20:37,456
I've got something in store for you.

653
01:20:38,458 --> 01:20:41,126
You'll wish you had died of pleasure
before this day is done.

654
01:20:41,294 --> 01:20:43,629
Now you shall learn
the wisdom of the lash.

655
01:20:43,797 --> 01:20:46,382
Oh, please,
haven't you done enough to me?

656
01:20:46,550 --> 01:20:51,178
I'll do things to you
that are beyond all known philosophies.

657
01:20:51,346 --> 01:20:53,681
Wait until I get my devices.

658
01:21:10,323 --> 01:21:11,490
Durand Durand?

659
01:21:24,838 --> 01:21:28,924
So... you recognized me?

660
01:21:29,676 --> 01:21:31,468
Recognized you?

661
01:21:31,636 --> 01:21:34,972
I could never have recognized you.
I thought you were only 25-years-old.

662
01:21:35,891 --> 01:21:37,349
What happened?

663
01:21:37,517 --> 01:21:39,894
Well, the mathmos
is not without its effect.

664
01:21:40,061 --> 01:21:42,146
But you've aged 30 years.

665
01:21:42,314 --> 01:21:45,274
The mathmos has its own
means of nourishment,

666
01:21:45,442 --> 01:21:47,860
and in return it teaches us truth.

667
01:21:48,028 --> 01:21:51,655
Dr. Durand,
could you hand me a garment?

668
01:21:52,824 --> 01:21:55,701
I have been sent here by the
President of the Republic of Earth,

669
01:21:55,869 --> 01:21:59,455
hopefully to save you and to
bring you back to our own Earth planet.

670
01:21:59,623 --> 01:22:03,000
Earth planet? Never.
Shall I tell you why?

671
01:22:03,168 --> 01:22:05,002
Because I know too much.

672
01:22:05,170 --> 01:22:07,880
Here in Sogo,
I have learned truth and essence.

673
01:22:08,048 --> 01:22:12,134
I speak of the dignity,
the nobility of pure evil.

674
01:22:12,302 --> 01:22:13,886
Would you hand me some boots?

675
01:22:14,804 --> 01:22:18,891
Humanism, morals, principles.
It's rubbish, nonsense.

676
01:22:19,601 --> 01:22:21,894
I speak only of truth and of essence.

677
01:22:22,062 --> 01:22:24,480
What have you
done with the Positronic Ray?

678
01:22:24,648 --> 01:22:28,567
- So, that's it.
- What does it do?

679
01:22:28,735 --> 01:22:32,655
All persons and objects in its path

680
01:22:32,822 --> 01:22:34,949
are deminimalized to the fourth level.

681
01:22:36,076 --> 01:22:37,284
- You mean...?
- That's right.

682
01:22:37,452 --> 01:22:41,747
They're placed in the
fourth dimension irretrievably.

683
01:22:41,915 --> 01:22:45,960
- But that's monstrous.
- Yes, it is, isn't it?

684
01:22:46,544 --> 01:22:49,254
Why haven't you used it
to take power here in Sogo?

685
01:22:49,422 --> 01:22:51,590
The Black Queen
must first be destroyed.

686
01:22:51,758 --> 01:22:56,095
But, as you no doubt observed, she is
always surrounded by her Black Guards.

687
01:22:56,262 --> 01:23:01,392
Whoever succeeds in killing her will be
put immediately to a horrible death.

688
01:23:01,559 --> 01:23:03,560
Hence my prudence.

689
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:10,401
I find horrible the idea that one could
do to me that which I do to others.

690
01:23:10,568 --> 01:23:14,780
But I was told that the Black Queen
was vulnerable while she sleeps?

691
01:23:14,948 --> 01:23:19,076
Oh, yes. There are no Black Guards
in the chamber of dreams.

692
01:23:19,244 --> 01:23:21,787
They're not needed there because
there's no access to the chamber.

693
01:23:21,955 --> 01:23:26,834
But, now it's time for my pleasure,
and your death.

694
01:23:28,169 --> 01:23:29,294
Wait.

695
01:23:32,340 --> 01:23:34,258
I know how you can enter
the chamber of dreams.

696
01:23:34,426 --> 01:23:36,093
You? How?

697
01:23:36,261 --> 01:23:39,304
- Speak.
- I have the key.

698
01:23:41,975 --> 01:23:45,269
- What does it look like?
- It's invisible.

699
01:23:46,354 --> 01:23:48,439
Then you really do have the key.

700
01:23:49,691 --> 01:23:51,692
I'll give you five minutes.

701
01:23:52,819 --> 01:23:54,820
Take me to the chamber of dreams.

702
01:23:56,322 --> 01:23:58,365
After you, Barbarella.

703
01:24:19,846 --> 01:24:21,847
To the right, Barbarella.

704
01:24:23,725 --> 01:24:25,684
Now to the left.

705
01:24:27,187 --> 01:24:28,395
Stop.

706
01:24:30,065 --> 01:24:31,523
Open it.

707
01:24:37,655 --> 01:24:41,784
- This must be the invisible wall.
- Yes, now where's the key?

708
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:51,543
- Come on, come on. Stop stalling!
- I'm trying to find the keyhole.

709
01:24:53,838 --> 01:24:55,172
No.

710
01:25:12,732 --> 01:25:15,818
You're trapped!
Trapped in the chamber of dreams.

711
01:25:15,985 --> 01:25:18,278
The mathmos will devour you.

712
01:25:18,446 --> 01:25:22,241
- Your Majesty!
- It's no use. I've got the two keys.

713
01:25:22,408 --> 01:25:25,369
The wall is sealed for all eternity.

714
01:25:25,537 --> 01:25:28,080
Dr. Durand, will you
give up this madness?

715
01:25:28,248 --> 01:25:30,666
Come back to Earth with me
before it's too late.

716
01:25:30,834 --> 01:25:33,627
Yes, I will return to Earth...

717
01:25:33,795 --> 01:25:36,088
...as its conqueror.

718
01:25:36,256 --> 01:25:41,260
Thanks to you, the queen, the last
obstacle to my plans, has been removed.

719
01:25:41,511 --> 01:25:42,970
Thank you, Barbarella.

720
01:25:46,307 --> 01:25:48,016
Nothing can stop me now.

721
01:25:48,184 --> 01:25:50,602
Today, master of Sogo.

722
01:25:50,770 --> 01:25:53,605
Tomorrow, master of the Earth,

723
01:25:53,773 --> 01:25:57,234
master of the galaxy,
master of the universe!

724
01:26:16,296 --> 01:26:21,091
Tell me, my fine, feathered friend,

725
01:26:21,259 --> 01:26:25,804
what do you think of
when you make love to Barbarella?

726
01:26:27,265 --> 01:26:31,393
An angel doesn't make love,
an angel is love.

727
01:27:46,094 --> 01:27:47,886
Wake up, Your Majesty!

728
01:27:48,054 --> 01:27:50,013
You must wake up!

729
01:27:52,225 --> 01:27:54,601
Vade retro, Earth girl.

730
01:27:54,769 --> 01:27:56,937
I know you don't really exist.

731
01:27:57,105 --> 01:27:59,815
That may be, Your Majesty,
but we'd better stick to what we see.

732
01:28:01,985 --> 01:28:06,905
Wretched girl, what have you done?
No one must enter while I sleep.

733
01:28:07,073 --> 01:28:09,616
Your concierge
is taking over the throne.

734
01:28:11,494 --> 01:28:13,578
What? What are you saying?

735
01:28:13,746 --> 01:28:15,872
It's true, and he's taken your key.

736
01:28:19,335 --> 01:28:24,256
- We're locked in, Your Majesty.
- The key, he's stolen the key.

737
01:28:25,717 --> 01:28:30,095
We're doomed... Doomed!

738
01:28:33,808 --> 01:28:38,061
He said the mathmos will devour us.
What did he mean?

739
01:28:40,064 --> 01:28:44,943
It is said that unless
I am alone in my chamber of dreams...

740
01:28:45,820 --> 01:28:48,739
...the mathmos will claim me.

741
01:28:56,122 --> 01:28:57,664
It's the Throne Room.

742
01:28:57,832 --> 01:29:01,084
I'm able to see into every
part of the city and the labyrinth.

743
01:29:01,252 --> 01:29:03,545
Unfortunately, it's a one-way screen.

744
01:29:03,713 --> 01:29:07,257
No one can see that
that bloody dog has locked me in.

745
01:29:07,425 --> 01:29:10,719
Your Majesty! Your Majesty,
we're under attack!

746
01:29:10,887 --> 01:29:14,598
The creatures in the labyrinth,
they're revolting, Your Majesty.

747
01:29:14,766 --> 01:29:17,726
How dare he interrupt my coronation?

748
01:29:18,936 --> 01:29:20,645
Dispatch the air armada.

749
01:29:23,191 --> 01:29:24,816
Quick, Your Majesty, the labyrinth.

750
01:29:28,696 --> 01:29:33,033
It's Dildano. He will save us.

751
01:30:03,523 --> 01:30:06,358
Your Majesty, they're all destroyed.

752
01:30:06,734 --> 01:30:09,986
Oh, good.
Not a creature left in the labyrinth.

753
01:30:10,154 --> 01:30:13,532
No aircraft left.
They have Earth weapons.

754
01:30:15,201 --> 01:30:19,079
Fool, liar, idiots!

755
01:30:19,705 --> 01:30:21,832
Must I do everything myself?

756
01:30:22,959 --> 01:30:27,003
- I'll destroy this rabble.
- He's gonna use the Positronic Ray.

757
01:31:07,753 --> 01:31:09,212
It works!

758
01:31:10,840 --> 01:31:13,425
It works, it works!

759
01:31:33,654 --> 01:31:34,779
All is lost.

760
01:31:36,782 --> 01:31:37,866
I must die.

761
01:31:38,034 --> 01:31:42,829
Very well, but it is I
who shall have the last laugh.

762
01:31:42,997 --> 01:31:46,958
The imbecile doesn't know
the secret of the Great Tyrant.

763
01:31:47,126 --> 01:31:49,461
The supreme weapon.

764
01:31:49,629 --> 01:31:54,633
- I shall free the mathmos.
- Do you think that's wise?

765
01:31:55,301 --> 01:31:56,760
Sogo will disappear.

766
01:31:58,137 --> 01:32:02,265
It will be the end, the apocalypse.

767
01:32:34,840 --> 01:32:38,593
- Where are we?
- In the mathmos and alive.

768
01:32:38,761 --> 01:32:40,387
I can see that, but why?

769
01:32:40,555 --> 01:32:43,848
It seems the mathmos
has created this bubble

770
01:32:44,016 --> 01:32:46,309
to protect itself from your innocence.

771
01:32:46,477 --> 01:32:47,811
That's nice.

772
01:32:54,986 --> 01:32:57,988
Oh, no. Stop! I command it.

773
01:32:58,155 --> 01:33:00,532
I'm Durand Durand.

774
01:33:03,536 --> 01:33:06,204
I'm the master of the mathmos!

775
01:33:09,083 --> 01:33:10,083
Fall back!

776
01:33:11,294 --> 01:33:13,378
Fall back...

777
01:33:14,630 --> 01:33:18,258
...or I'll destroy you
with my Positronic Ray.

778
01:33:43,200 --> 01:33:45,869
You are so good,
you made the mathmos vomit.

779
01:33:46,037 --> 01:33:48,079
Pygar! What have you done to Pygar?

780
01:33:48,247 --> 01:33:53,043
He was sent to the mathmos, but I see
he's no more digestible than you are.

781
01:33:53,210 --> 01:33:55,253
You can't be dead.

782
01:33:56,172 --> 01:34:01,051
You win, Barbarella, but the Earth
has lost its last great dictator.

783
01:34:01,218 --> 01:34:04,888
The genius of the Positronic Ray.

784
01:34:12,438 --> 01:34:13,730
Why don't you give him

785
01:34:14,065 --> 01:34:15,398
a mouth to mouth?

786
01:34:15,566 --> 01:34:17,567
I have a better idea.

787
01:34:25,951 --> 01:34:29,120
Please. Pygar, please.

788
01:34:30,456 --> 01:34:31,998
Please, wake up.

789
01:34:36,253 --> 01:34:40,632
We must fly back to my spaceship.
Do you have the strength?

790
01:35:21,674 --> 01:35:25,468
Pygar, what did you save her for,

791
01:35:25,636 --> 01:35:27,846
after all the terrible things
she's done to you?

792
01:35:28,013 --> 01:35:30,557
An angel has no memory.
